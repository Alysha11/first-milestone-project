# User Centric Front End Milestone Project

 

## Band site for The Monkees

This project is a website for fans (existing and new) of 1960’s rock band ‘The Monkees’.  It a responsive and mobile-first designed performing well on different screen sizes. This website is static apart from the navigation bar (created through Bootstrap 4).

It simple to use with easy navigation and is aesthetically appealing with some nostalgic elements to represent the bands history.  Together with the ease of use and look the site is a place the band can use to showcase their music, publicise availability to perform at events and highlight a social media presence thus fully fulfilling the brief that was provided. 

This piece was created purely for educational purposes. 

 

### UX

 

**The business:**

 “The Monkees” - a band with 50 years of experience.

 

**Requirements:**

- A site where the band can showcase their music

- Platform to publicise availability to perform at events

- Links to social media presence specifically Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

 

**The audience:**


The users of this website will mainly be fans of the band, possibly long-time considering the 50 year history. The users will also consist of new/ potential fans and those looking to book the band for an event.

 

**User stories:**

 
Established Fan:

>I have been a fan for many years. I use the website frequently to find and listen to hits. I want to be kept informed of latest news about the band whilst visiting and have access to social media sites for even more.

 

New Fan:

>I love all things 1960s – the carefree vibe, bold colours and the catchy music. I collect vintage vinyls and enjoy discovering music from this time.  I use the website to find out more about the band and find their back-catalogue.

 

Potential client:

> I go to the website as The Monkees are on my list of dream possibilities to perform at my wedding. I want some more information, I expect the website to look professional and to reinforce the appeal of booking the band.

 

**Scope:**

Based on the needs of the business and the target audience created a website that contains:

1. A showcase of the music. 

The ‘music’ page which contains:

    * Discography

    * Audio clips

    * Videos

2. Info on the band

      * An ‘about’ section

      * A ‘news’ section to publicise latest information

      * Social links

3. A place to dedicated to the band’s availability to perform at events in the form of the ‘bookings’ page:

    * A contact form

4. A nod to the 1960s in regards to aesthetics

5. As the users will likely come from wide ranging backgrounds from all over the world from the long-time fans of an older demographic to new younger fans I have made a site that is easy to navigate and incorporates modern conventions.

 

**Wireframes**

On designing the pages I used wireframes considering both mobile and desktop views. These were created using www.draw.io  and can be found:

 

[Desktop](https://github.com/Alysha11/first-milestone-project/blob/master/other/desktopWireframes.pdf)

 

[Mobile](https://github.com/Alysha11/first-milestone-project/blob/master/other/mobileWireframes.pdf)

 

### Features

**Navigation**

 

*Mobile and Tablet*

The navigation is a simple hamburger style dropdown on the top right of mobile view. When open the page headings are displayed with the branding on top. Clicking on the brand will take users to the home page however there is also a ‘home’ page listed which is more explicit.

 

*Desktop*

The navigation runs across the top right of the screen with the branding to the top left. Both are more centred and larger than default Bootstrap as the uthe intention is to draw users eyes the attractive branding. On hover the navigation options turn grey so that the user is clear where they are pointing to. The navigation bar also has a fixed position which adds to the ease of use for user’s never having to scroll to reach the navigation menu.

 

**Home Page**

The page welcomes users to the site. It features a banner with some text which is a feature consistent throughout the site. It provides clear information for users on where they are and what they can expect.

There is a psychedelic background over which a cartoon representation of the band is featured. The background was created by using CSS gradients and is reminiscent of 1960s styling. It is a bold background and draws in the attention of the user and all text is on more muted backgrounds so that it is still friendly for those reading text.

 

**Flower & Social links**

 

*Flower*

At the bottom of all the pages there is a red flower image that was used as another nod to the era of the bands beginnings. It forms an attractive and contrasting separation between the page content and the social links footer.

 
*Social Links*

Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are present as requested in the brief. The Font Awesome icons for these brands are used at the bottom of the page allowing users links to the social pages easily. The social icons link to the bands official social accounts.

 

**About Page**

Here is where users learn more about the band members. The styling is bold with alternating row colours to clearly separate the band members. In the desktop version users see alternating text first, photo first on each row and a shadow effect is used to have this whole section stand out from the background.  These styling choices add interest for the user in an otherwise potentially text heavy page.

 

**Music Pages**

 
*Discography*
 

A gallery of album covers forms the discography. Users can see the names and release year of the band’s back catalogue.

 
*Audio*

 
Some of the bands famous tracks are listed here in audio players. Users can listen using the controls.  On desktop screen the audio tracks are listed in-line as the audio players themselves are not so interesting to look at I ensured that they do not take up a lot of screen space.


*Video*

 
Users can watch videos in this area of the music page. As the videos are embedded it is not necessary for users to leave the site.

 

**News Page**

 

The news page features three Bootstrap 4 “cards” these were styled to have a zoom effect on the cover images. Each article is visually appealing and contains information users would look for in news - an image related to the story, a headline, date published and a link to where users can find the full article.

 

**Bookings Page**

 

This page contains a simple form that enables users to begin a booking enquiry with the band, it contains validation for required fields and directs to another page to provide some user feedback.

 

*Features Left to Implement*

+ As this project is strictly a static site I have used standard HTML audio players which vary in look based on browser. If I were to add further features I would want to include a custom designed audio player.

+ The bookings form to be functional.

+ To add cookie, privacy, terms and conditions information in the form of modals so that they do not take up screen space

 

### Technologies Used

 
+ [HTML5]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) for structure

+ [CSS]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for custom styling

+ [Bootstrap 4]( https://getbootstrap.com/)  used for grid layout, cards and navigation functionality.

+ [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  used for icons on about, news, music and booking page. 

+ [Google Fonts]( https://fonts.google.com/)  For ‘Raleway’ and ‘Ranchers’ fonts.

 

### Testing

 
Reflecting back on the user stories I tested to ensure all uses would be met which they were as follows:

_established fan_ can listen to favourite hits with the audio players included in the music page, they have a dedicated page to news that is eye catching and clearly dated so can tell that they are seeing regularly updated articles, and they have working links to social media on all pages.

_new fan_ has an attractive discography to view working on different screen sizes, it includes the title and release year of each album. They also enjoy visuals that provide a nod to the 1960s –flower divider, font style, bold seperation on colour and the gradient background on the home page.

_potential client_ will find the pages are professional looking and the booking form simple and easy to use with the validation working reminding user in the case of errors. They are also given success feedback once submitted. 

 
Apart from my own tests I also sought the opinion of a couple of friends and fellow Code Institute students who provided positive feedback. Through it was pointed out that not all the album cards on the music page were uniform in size as the background colour wraped itself around the text which varied in length. The different sizes looked ok for me but i decided to go with uniformity as a result of the comment and i added a fixed height to this section on the album covers. 
 

**Process**

1. Code was tested using W3C markup validation and W3C Jigsaw CSS validation.

_Something that was highlighted was that I had put the flower divider icon in a section tag which does not contain a h1. To rectify this I read up on [semantic elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) and felt that the figure tag most closely fit that part of the code and replaced the section tag with figure tag and as a result had no errors using the validators._

 

2. I tested that the navigation work as expected using a number of browsers and screen sizes.

 

3. Checked that other links direct correctly (social, youTube videos and news articles).

 

4. Checked that the layout was as expected in the different browsers and at different screen sizes.

 
_One difficulty I came across was with the audio players. On a smaller desktop screen size the individual players would touch each other. I was able to fix this by adding media queries to reduce, then increase the audio player width according to screen size_

 
5.Tested the audio players worked by playing them.
 

6.Tested the videos worked by playing them.

 
7. Tested the booking form contained correct validation by leaving input(s) empty, by trying incorrect input of email and finally by completing correctly and checking that I was directed to feedback info once submitted.


Results of the tests were put in a table and can be seen [Here](https://github.com/Alysha11/first-milestone-project/blob/master/other/testingSpreadsheet.xlsx).

 

### Deployment

Deployed via Github Pages and can be viewed here: https://alysha11.github.io/first-milestone-project/

 
_after deployment I discovered that my audio files stopped playing and that the images on the news articles were not displaying. To rectify this I removed the root /_
